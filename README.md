# C++ Basics Template

Welcome to the template repository for our introductory coding lessons. This serves as a quick way to get a working C++ environment, so you can follow along with the projects that end each section.

## Getting Started

The first thing you'll need to do is make your own repository, which you can do by clicking the "Use this template" button.

Then you'll want to open the repository in a codespace:

Wait for it to load, and then you should be good to go! All of your development dependencies should be installed.

To build all of your mini projects, type the following in the terminal:
```sh
make all
```
